# Real-Time-Sorting-Visualization-
This repository contains a Python project that implements and visualizes various sorting algorithms, including Selection Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort. Each algorithm is demonstrated through a visualization tool built with 'matplotlib' to help users understand their behavior step by step.
